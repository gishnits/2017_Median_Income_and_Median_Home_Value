2017 Median Income and Median Home Value by US County

This is an exploratory in the 2017 Median Income and 2017 Median Home Value by county in the US to explore the percentage of income to home value. In other word which counties in the US had the highest and lowest percentage of income to house value. Python is used to clean and combine the datasets. For the Visualization and analysis I exported to Tableau.
